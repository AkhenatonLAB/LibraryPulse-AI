Currently, we are using many debug features for our sake (etc. arrows points which direction a person has moving) they will be removed or added into a debug mode for performance

Known Issues: Because of our test environment debug arrows are showing reversed direction of a persons movement this is caused of mirrored image frames we are getting, we will solve it when we had our proper test environment
